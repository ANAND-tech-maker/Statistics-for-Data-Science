### **a.Bernoulli_Distribution.ipynb**
Topics:
- Definition of Bernoulli Trial  
- Discrete Outcomes (0 or 1)  
- PMF Formula:  
  **P(X = 1) = p**  
  **P(X = 0) = 1 − p**  
- Mean & Variance  
- Real-life examples (coin toss, pass/fail)  
- Python implementation  

---

### **b.Binomial_Distribution.ipynb**
Topics:
- Repeated Bernoulli Trials  
- PMF Formula:  
  **P(X = k) = nCk · pᵏ · (1 − p)ⁿ⁻ᵏ**  
- Parameters: n (trials), p (success probability)  
- Mean & Variance  
- Use cases (quality control, survey success count)  
- Python examples  

---

### **c.Poisson_Distribution.ipynb**
Topics:
- Probability of events over time/space  
- PMF Formula:  
  **P(X = k) = (λᵏ · e⁻λ) / k!**
