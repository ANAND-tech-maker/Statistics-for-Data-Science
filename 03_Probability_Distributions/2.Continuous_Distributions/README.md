# 📈 Continuous Probability Distributions

This folder covers the most important **Continuous Distributions** used in statistics, machine learning, and data science.

## 📂 Files Included

---

### **a.Normal_Distribution**
Topics:
- Bell-shaped curve  
- Standard Normal vs General Normal  
- PDF Formula (in words):  
  Probability density depends on mean (μ) and spread (σ)  
- Z-Score  
- Properties (68–95–99.7 rule)  
- Applications (IQ scores, heights, errors)  
- Python example with plots  

---

### **b.Uniform_Distribution**
Topics:
- Equal probability over an interval  
- Continuous range [a, b]  
- PDF Formula (in words):  
  Constant probability density between a and b  
- Mean & Variance  
- Real-life examples (random number generator)  
- Python example  

---

### **c.Exponential_Distribution**
Topics:
- Time between events in a Poisson process  
- Parameter λ (rate)  
- PDF Formula (in words):  
  Probability decreases exponentially as time increases  
- Memoryless property  
- Use cases (waiting time, machine failure time)  
- Python example  

---

### **d.Log_Normal_Distribution**
Topics:
- A variable whose log is normally distributed  
- Skewed-right distribution  
- PDF behavior explained in words  
- Mean/Median/Mode differences  
- Applications (stock prices, income distribution)  
- Python example  

---

### **e.Pareto_Distribution**
Topics:
- Heavy-tailed distribution  
- Used to model wealth, income, failures  
- Parameters (shape α, scale xm)  
- PDF Formula (in words):  
  Probability decreases rapidly for large values  
- 80/20 Rule relation  
- Python example

## 🎯 Purpose
This folder explains the commonly used **Continuous Distributions** that are essential for:
- Machine Learning  
- Statistical Modeling  
- Data Science Projects  
- Probability & inference  

Each notebook contains:
- Concept explanation  
- Formula in words  
- Real-world use cases  
- Python implementation
